# Malicious-extensions
 In my pc i didn't find any malicious extensions.
 
Here are some examples of harmful browser extensions that have actively compromised user privacy and security in recent years:

### Notorious Harmful Extensions

- “ChatGPT for Google” (Trojanized versions): Stole Facebook session cookies to hijack user accounts and promote malicious content.
- “Quick access to Chat GPT”: Used as an intermediary for ChatGPT but was actually designed to steal Facebook business account logins.
- “ChromeLoader”: Distributed via pirated content, this malware installed browser extensions that injected intrusive ads, modified search results, and redirected users to malicious sites.
- “Netflix Party” and “Netflix Party 2”: Tracked browsing history and injected affiliate links for profit.
- “Full Page Screenshot Capture — Screenshotting”: Tracked user data and secretly altered cookies on e-commerce sites.
- “friGate Light” and “friGate CDN”: Promised encrypted traffic and access to locked sites, but also delivered malware and collected sensitive user data.
- “SaveFrom.Net”: Enabled convenient media downloads but collected and leaked user data, including IP addresses and browsing habits.
- “SHARPEXT” (by SharpTongue/Kimsuky): Specialized email spyware; stole credentials and continuously monitored user emails.
- “Hola VPN”: Allowed access to blocked content but tracked user behavior and left traffic unencrypted exposing security risks.
- “PDF Toolbox”: Downloaded additional malware after installation, increasing attack surface.

### Common Malicious Features

- Data theft: Extensions harvest sensitive data like banking credentials, email accounts, and browsing history.
- Surveillance: Some extensions monitor keystrokes, take screenshots, and track user behavior.
- Content manipulation: Injecting ads, altering web pages, and using social engineering to trick users.
- Request forgery: Initiate unauthorized transactions or change account settings without consent.
- Browser hijacking: Redirect traffic, promote fake updates, and enable further malware installs.

Many harmful extensions masquerade as tools for productivity, entertainment, or convenience, often accumulating thousands or even millions of installs before being detected and removed. Regularly review extensions and remove suspicious or unused ones to protect against these threats.
